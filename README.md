- 👋 Hi, I’m @Angelsbane93
- 👀 I’m new to the programming world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++, C# and Python... I know it's too much to study multiple languages, but I have difficulty concentrating on one thing at a time, so I
figured I would force myself to study several at once to understand the syntax, format and structures involved... wish me lucK?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of yet, just looking to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me is a pain in the butt. Seriously.
